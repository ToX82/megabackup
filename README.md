megabackup
==========

A simple BASH script useful to backup mySQL databases and files.

Based upon an idea found here: [Ubuntu-it forum](http://forum.ubuntu-it.org/viewtopic.php?p=3284474#p3284474).

Needs megacl if you want to save backups on mega.co.nz [megacl git page](https://github.com/gissehel/megacl) and a [mega.co.nz](https://mega.co.nz/) account, of course .


## INSTALLATION STEPS:
* place this file everywhere you want
* edit the configuration settings as your needs

### OPTIONAL
* install and configure megacl (configuration is just a matter of running "mcl login --email=dave@example.com" )
* set BACKUP_ON_MEGA = true
