megabackup
==========

A simple BASH script useful to backup mySQL databases and files

Based upon an idea found here: [Ubuntu-it forum](http://forum.ubuntu-it.org/viewtopic.php?p=3284474#p3284474)

Needs megacmd if you want to save backups on mega.co.nz [megacmd git page](https://github.com/t3rm1n4l/megacmd/) and a mega account, of course [mega.co.nz](https://mega.co.nz/)


## INSTALLATION STEPS:
* place this file everywhere you want
* edit the configuration settings as your needs

### OPTIONAL
* install and configure megacmd (remember to create a ~/.megacmd.json configure file)
* enable BACKUP_ON_MEGA setting
